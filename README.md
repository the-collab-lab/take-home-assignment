## Exercise: Formatting Text

Create a new React app for formatting text. It should have two modes: one that changes every letter to uppercase and one that changes every letter to lowercase. Create a UI to select/switch between these two modes.

For example, if we had the following as input:

```
This is some text.
```

Submitting the form in the uppercase mode should output the following:

```
THIS IS SOME TEXT.
```

And submitting the form in the lowercase mode should output the following:

```
this is some text.
```

If you add testing, you may use a testing library you like, but the main code must not require any additional libraries or resources beyond the standard built-in libraries.

Your code will be evaluated on three criteria:

- Correctness: Does it follow all the instructions?
- Code Quality: Is it readable and well structured?
- Idiomatic Code Style: Does it follow the stylistic conventions of the language, such as indentation and capitalization?
